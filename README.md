## Twilight Remote Desktop

This project aims to build a open source remote desktop suitable for any uses including gaming.

It was [previously written in C++](https://github.com/jsonmona/twilight-cpp), but was rewritten in Rust to improve safety and fix threading-related bugs.

This project is currently in pre-alpha, so no prebuilt binaries are provided.


## Note

I'm busy serving the mandatory military service in South Korea, please expect delayed response times up to 6 weeks.

That also means I don't really have any time to work on this project. :(


## License

Copyright (c) 2023. Yeomin Yoon. All rights reserved.

This project has no license attached yet.
That effectively makes the project somewhat like a closed-source one.
Of course, I plan to open source it.
I just need some time to research which license to apply.

I'm considering either GPLv3 or AGPLv3, with some additional clause to allow using vendor proprietary API like NVENC.
As far as I understand, their API is incompatible with GPL style license, so they need some additional clause.
I may be wrong, and that's why I hesitate to attach some license.
